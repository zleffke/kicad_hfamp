# bs170_pushpull

## Version 1
* Simple BS170 pushpull design
* utilizes two SMT BS170s, but added through hole pads for TO-92 testing.
* utilizes minicircuits baluns...ADTXXXXXX version
    * attempting to achieve wideband 'no tune' design.
    * not yet sure which impedance ratio to use
    * overlaid with through hole in order to test other baluns (hand made wirewound binocular...)
* No actual biasing circuit...planning to test offboard bias circuits.  Did include simple potentiometer based bias.
* Trying to achieve some amount of gain with a 5V drain voltage, most designs use 12V...
* Rev- design intended to test various configurations for biasing and to measure S-parameters.
